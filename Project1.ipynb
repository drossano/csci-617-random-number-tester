    "The decisions we make while solving problems with programming are similar to many of the decisions we make in life, often with no one correct answer, but instead require analysis of the tradeoffs among the possible answers and careful consideration of the context or environment they exist in.  Testing code is no stranger to this, and with that said, autotesting the function associated with our main program comes down to the tradeoff between the complexity of trying to automate the multiple side effects associated with a number of functions that it coordinates the execution for (`random.randrange`, `dilbert`, `randu` ... ) versus the easy and non-complex manual testing that could be done given the relatively simple nature of the main program's code itself.  Therefore, the course facilitators will manually grade your main() function, and ensure that it meets the requirements.  The rubric (grading guide) used by the course facilitators is shown here.  Please check that you have met all the requirements below – then follow the instructions [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ball-state-univeristy-introduction-to-programming/assignment-submission/QgjpS/submit-project-1) to submit your final version of the project."
